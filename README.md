Build an ML Pipeline for Short-Term Rental Prices in NYC
================


This project is part of the [ ML DevOps Engineer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-dev-ops-engineer-nanodegree--nd0821)
 program, from Udacity. I developed an end-to-end reusable ML pipeline to
 estimate the typical price for a given property based on the cost of similar
 properties. New data is received in bulk every week, so this pipeline can be
 used with the same cadence to retrain the model.
